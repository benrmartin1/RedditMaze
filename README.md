# Reddit Maze

Made in Unity.

I like the idea of games with autogenerated parts, where the source of the data is not controlled by the creator of the game. This "game" is a simple first person maze, where you spawn at the entrance and try to get to the exit. The maze should always be solvable, with a start location and finish. 

The fun part is the wall textures, which are pulled from Reddit using Reddit's API. You can choose the subreddit you want to pull from, so it's a fun and silly way to browse an image subreddit while playing a game.

I want to add a menu so the user can choose the subreddit and size of the maze, currently this is done through Unity public script variables. I'd also like to add a win state when you get to the end of the maze.
